Wolfy Tom says:
 doh!
 phew
Beccas says:
 silly msn
 it hates me sometimes
  
Wolfy Tom says:
 did you glance at the doument/wiki page?
Beccas says:
 I've been reading it
Wolfy Tom says:
 you see i have done much backround thoughts too
Beccas says:
 I noticed!
 I don't understand how a star can change its gravity though
 and in such little time
Wolfy Tom says:
 unfortunately i wasnt so good at doing background ideas for te charactyers
 i'm drinking inbru!
 irnbru*
Beccas says:
 that would make it VERY difficult to have anything growing, OR is that the two suns that the planet revolves around?
Wolfy Tom says:
 that's the two sunds the planet revolves around
Beccas says:
 beta lyrae
Wolfy Tom says:
 you're a quick study beccas
  
 the suns being weird is how i came up for the reason the planet has weird weather and stuff
Beccas says:
 oooh
 I see
 that makes sense.  
Wolfy Tom says:
 i had a Full House breakfast
Beccas says:
 you did?!
 was it yumm
Wolfy Tom says:
 egg, bacon,  , beans, black pudding, hash browns, toast and coffee
 it was yum but now i'm super thirsty so i'm drinking irnbru
Beccas says:
 what's irnbru
 ?
Wolfy Tom says:
 a bright ornage fizzy pop that tastes kinda like iron
Beccas says:
   LIKE IRON?! haha
Wolfy Tom says:
 it's scottish
Beccas says:
 explains it all
 tom
Wolfy Tom says:
  
Beccas says:
 I think you should right a sequal.
 when voth steps through, that's a good lead into the next one
Wolfy Tom says:
 but havent written this one yet!
Beccas says:
  
 I know.
 but I like the idea
 and sometimes, you write the last chapter first, and fill in the rest?
Wolfy Tom says:
  
 i guess so
 one of the first things i had for this book was the last line
 well, the last line of dialogue
 "Let's go before we get wet..."
 the joke being both are soaking wet
Beccas says:
  
Wolfy Tom says:
 cos it rains so much during the few days the story takes place
Beccas says:
 that would make it cool, like it was going full circle,
Wolfy Tom says:
  
Beccas says:
 so it is only a few days
 I was wondering about that, cos there is a lot of beautiful description about the scenery, but not so much of the days it takes
Wolfy Tom says:
 you think it will work?
Beccas says:
 yeah it will work
 the characters aren't as simple as you make them out to be... I haven't finished yet, I skim read it and am going back and reading it all... but I like the hive buildings
 are they meant to be like a bee hive? or is that just their name?
Wolfy Tom says:
 hadn't thought in great detail about that
 i was picturing a desert world so the buildings were gonna be a golden adobe colour and clustered/huddled together to find shade from the sun
 maybe built on an oasis
Beccas says:
 oh nice, I can totally picture that, 
 where do they get their energy from? the sun?
Wolfy Tom says:
  m
 would make sens
 it's a pretty much constant resource
Beccas says:
 so, maybe the hive could be covered in golden sun discs that catch the light, and transport it, in it's unpolluted form to a central dissipater, which evenly spreads the energy throughout the hive and the light the discs catch is actual sunlight that get's stored in the sun room.. and maybe, that could come into play later in the book when there is some sort of rival between characters? and and..
  
Wolfy Tom says:
 oooh!
Beccas says:
 I dunno
 just a thought
  
Wolfy Tom says:
 the portal ring would require much power - that could work well
Beccas says:
 YEAH!!
Wolfy Tom says:
 i hadn't considered that
Beccas says:
 and undiluted sun energy has that potential!
 um, you know how voth was raised in the oasis, so water is a big commodity? what do the other folk do for water?
Wolfy Tom says:
 balthazar was raised as a rich boy in the oasis - voth was like a normal person - all water is recycled and rationed
Beccas says:
 oops
 balthazar. okay
 that's cool
Wolfy Tom says:
 much water is imported through the cargo portal from the beta-lyrae world
Beccas says:
 only. gotta be a little careful, cos that movie the book of eli, that's how people get their water oo
 ooh
 I see
 that;s really good.
 hm..
 this reminds me of a show...
 um, hang on I'll try to find it
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubwoDfX5Xig
 skyland... it's a good show  
 your book is dfferent to that though,,, 
 oh
 I love the description of the land, how it's like big tabletops and how the water just runs off the edge and hardly makes it to the ocean!!
Wolfy Tom says:
 look up "tepui" in wiki
Beccas says:
 sounds hawa n
Wolfy Tom says:
 south american
Beccas says:
 oh nice
 um, yeah. cape town. 
 that mountain is one
 and majority of the blue mountains...
 yeah. tabletop
  
 that's clever to use another word meaning the same thing, that sounds different so people will think it's a new thing?
 honestly I didn't know what a tepui was, and now I do. 
 I had an idea from the description but that was about it
 so cudos to you wofl
  
Wolfy Tom says:
  you have a good way of seeing through thought patterns i didnt even know i'd had!
Beccas says:
  
  
 hey, sometimes it just takes another head to look at it... right?
 I like your ideas though
 I think they make for a really exciting story
 and, I like the background stuff, the stuff I've read is very interesting, and I kinda want to read more...
Wolfy Tom says:
  
Beccas says:
 oh. maybe for some inspiration, you should check out some authors, like, Simon Brown, Pamela Freeman, Garth Nix...
 some series in particular by those authors are, inheritance by simon brown, full circle trilogy by pamela freeman and both the keys to the kingdom series by garth nix, oh, and shades children... also by garth nix. in particular, check out sabrial, lirael and abhorsen... they are the first keys to the kingdom series by garth, and BLOODY AMAZING... awesome authors in terms of "quest" fantasy
 again, just an idea
Wolfy Tom says:
 am gonna have to save this convo so i dont forgetall the stuff you've said
Beccas says:
