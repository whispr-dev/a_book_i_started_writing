{\*\generator Msftedit 5.41.15.1515;}\viewkind4\uc1\pard\f0\fs20 Culture desert world - describe the courtyard where CG tends to his fish.\par
\par
He recieves notification of his mission. mulls over whether to do it or not. decides to go for it.\par
\par
Waterboard man gives his useful advice about not eating. CG ignores him but then vomit out of excitement/fear.\par
\par
Clearly the waterboard guy knows what he's about - CG listenes to what he has to say. He tells CG that the mission will affect not just his future but the future of whole worlds.\par
\par
Preparing to travel - [seeD&D planes manual?]\par
\par
[Sidekick is introduced?]\par
\par
We learn of the Beta Lyrae world's politics, history etc.\par
\par
Mission details - twarting a trade-war that could upset cultures supply of the drug\par
\par
The details of the drug trade are expounded upon.\par
\par
Actual portal journey the chamber itself, the ceremony and consumption of the drug.\par
\par
Description of the actual journey.\par
\par
\par
Arrival and description of the difference in surroundings/people etc.?\par
\par
Immediate delivery of the message - we learn that CG is secretly working for a trade guild-family\par
\par
Explanation of the trade guild-families?\par
\par
We also realise therefore that the drug is duff and hence the CG is stuck until he can get more drug.\par
\par
We are introduced to the girl in the guise of a city-state official who will be his guide.\par
\par
The first weird flash happens but is brief and mild - written off as portal weirdness/drugs though a suspicion that maybe the girl is special bcause of the interaction triggering the weird. \par
\par
The CG is persuded to come out and enjoy carnevale with the girl and her friends [including the man who will be fitted up for the murder in the end cos he cheats] \par
\par
Explanation of Carnevale\par
\par
The girl begins to make a play for the CG, plying him with drugs and music.\par
\par
the CG parties hard and falls for the girl in the haze of dugs and music.\par
\par
CG goes to restroom. \par
\par
The murder is discovered.\par
\par
The CG is blamed, and possibly framed [they can blame him cos the murder is done using a very advanced poison, nearly indistinguishable from the party drugs - only likely source is cultured people] by the city-state.\par
\par
The City-state can't imprison him as a diplomat but can stop him using the portal by claiming it is inoperative. but this means they need the issues sorted before the next cargo is due to be shipped or all kinds of trouble occurs.\par
\par
CG is given chill pill and sent to his rooms for the night under guard on the chambers(city state claims for his safety) \par
\par
\par
CG wakes to what he thinks are carnevale drums. \par
\par
he doesn't realise they are war drums so doesnt recognise that, and then understand why people are panicing.\par
\par
then he sees the blimp-triremes. unrest is building to a climax already - his mission is failing before he has even started.\par
\par
under supervsion of the girl - the guy is released "to do his diplomatic mission"\par
\par
attacks from the nomadic tribesmen who are gone malignant due to virus infected drug are also becoming significant, though relatively ineffectual to city state they can interrupt the supply of drug resin via the caravans.\par
\par
the supply of the raw drug resin becoming even more intermittent is the council's excuse for closing the portal. \par
\par
As the problems with the supply of raw drug material become clearer, the weird flashes start to become more frequent and longer and more intense - though CG can no longer blame it on the drugs/partying/portal weirdness/girl - it is clear that he is carrying the secret to the improved drug in his head and and the need to travel to the alchemists becomes apparent, \par
\par
it must be extracted and communicated/stored by people who understand even if not fully or risk being lost forever. The girl begins to try much harder to seduce the CG since he clearly knows the secret of the imrpoved drug and so is more than just a mission or an interesting prospect but also a route for her to regain her family's power base and stability.\par
\par
The night before they leave for the cloud-forest she seduces him but \par
\par
drugs him and steals the sample he has with him, not knowing it is duff cos she hasn't read the message that tells him why he is trapped.\par
\par
\par
They travel deep into the cloud forest by blimp, to reach the home of the particular alchemist family the girl came from - hopefully who can help, \par
\par
but the weird flashes get worse,\par
\par
and during the journey the blimp encounters another rival blimp/air ship which leads to a battle \par
\par
[someone important is injured or dies]. \par
\par
CG wakes in the cloud forest to witness a hint, but not realise, that the girl is cheating on him [with sidekick? no - just another politically innocent main character - love triangle!]. \par
\par
whilst he's been out cold the alchemist has successfully extracted the info from CGs head but in a moment of greed and power grabbing threatens to stop him from returning and keep the info to himself - \par
\par
CG comes up with plan of blackmail that his trading guild-family will release the drug they've already made onto the market if he isnt returned by the end of the seven-day rains - believeable since they think he has access to the working improved drug i.e. that which the girl stole.\par
\par
they also aren't to fussed by letting CG go since they now know how to make the drug \par
\par
[though they are missing something crucial? something only CG knows hence can rise to power?].\par
\par
\par
Due to the blimp barely making it home and being extensively damaged the same route back to the city-state is now closed. \par
\par
With help of the alchemists the CG returns via the dangerous lower cloud-forest levels, travelling with a resin caravan to the city-state, lead/guarded by cloud-forest nomads. \par
\par
the journey is arduous and tough, but throughout he hopes for his relationship with the girl to grow. \par
\par
unfortunately she is no longer needing his info or secrets so has focussed her attentions on someone else [sidekick? no - a politically innocent member of the group who travels with for the whole adventure] i.e. is cheating on him.\par
 \par
CG discovers the betrayal [how? needs to be very painful experience]. \par
\par
CG decides to blame the girl by planting the evidence of the toxin on her but \par
\par
the guy takes the blame [i.e. claims to be a culture spy] planning to escape through the portal. \par
\par
CG needs to solve/successfuly blame the murder to get the city-state to let him return home. blamed man must be an obstacle to getting into power, but from which power group and how does him being blamed allow the CG to win?\par
\par
\par
The CG goes to confront the girl and is still ready to reconcile - he is confused but not entirely full of hate towards her \par
\par
he has more anger towards the person she cheated with [sidekick? no - the person he blames for the trader murder.] \par
\par
but when he gets there he finds the two of them fighting over the stolen drug - the ensuing struggle results in the death of the blamed man (who needed to flee the city-state)\par
\par
and the revealing of the girl's true colours (she is working for the culture). \par
\par
When the girl attempts to flee with the drug he allows her to use the portal knowing full well she will be unable to return and will go to an unknown place - essentially a death sentence, but with a chance of ending up in a better place.\par
\par
 loose ends tied up (cheaters dead and gone, beaten the culture spies, the city-state spies, his trade guild's old stalwarts and the alchemists) the CG now has the working drug, the leverage over the city-state, the alchemists helping him and the culture still believeing that he is on their side - he is in position to take power in the trading guild-family in the power vacuum created by the murder.\par
\par
[perhaps he really did do it after all? indeed we discover he did do it - and used the system to get rid o enemies along the way] \par
\par
the CG steps into the portal triumphant and vanishes - we are left to wonder if he made it ok, opening for sequel.\par
