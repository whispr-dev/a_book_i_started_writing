 hello

 theres a spammer!!!
Wolfy Tom says:
 do you going to listen ASOT500?
David says:
 http://forums.di.fm/news-and-current-events/laidback-luke-more-mixmash-pool-party-the-national-hotel-pool-220400/#post4328272
 he's posted lots of threads, many of them double and in wrong sections and stuff
 its at 500 already?
Wolfy Tom says:
 tonight in an hr and a bit
David says:
 dunno
 maybe
 are you?
Wolfy Tom says:
 i'll give it a go - curioosity and to see the state of the world
David says:
 of all the artists that will be performing at the various ASOT500 parties, Armin is not one i'm interested in...
 his sets are getting pretty boring imo
 his live sets have become more and more like his radio show...just the latest and greatest and little track selection based on the actual tracks and harmonics etc
Wolfy Tom says:
 not certain i've heard one
David says:
 im pretty sure you have at previous ASOT celebrations
 what i find weird is that at the events there are multiple zones, but instead of putting all the trance djs in one area, all the house djs in another etc it seems they've just randomly assigned them time slots in random areas
Wolfy Tom says:
 i dont know squat about that kinda stuff
David says:
 but i have to hand it to him, that's one HELL of a line up for the party in the netherlands
 unlike most events with 20+ djs i'd actually want to see most of them
Wolfy Tom says:
 shit
 am filling in the census
David says:
 actually, i'd like to see 29 out of 40, and some of the others i don't know
Wolfy Tom says:
 but i cant remember my job title
David says:
 census?
 hehe my old job title was Super Mario lol
Wolfy Tom says:
 mine is something like Human Resources Administrator
David says:
 what a shame...companies need to be more creative with that sort of stuff
Wolfy Tom said (18:38):
 i might listen to mocean district instead - this is already doing my head in
Wolfy Tom said (18:42):
  
Wolfy Tom said (18:45):
 i needs your halps
David says:
 whta what what
Wolfy Tom says:
 i need a reason tht a theoretically similar group of city-states could support themselves foodwise whereas another fails to do so
David says:
 less fertile land?
 polution etc
Wolfy Tom says:
  m... not sure that works - no fossil fuel tech or heavy industry - a subsitence based on clean tech and bioengineered plants etc
David says:
 no i meant that as two seperate things
 less fertile land as in different soil
 sandy ground vs chalky ground vs rocky ground etc
Wolfy Tom says:
 why would the soil be different hen they a started out the same...
  
David says:
 you didnt say they started the same hehe
Wolfy Tom says:
 maybe a microbe in soil
 introduced by accident
David says:
 are we talking two purely hypothetical places starting on the exact same basis or two places that could actually exist on different parts of the planet
 cause simply location by itself can make all the difference
 europe vs asia is a great example...
 we can grow wheat, they have to do with rice
 to feed 100 people with wheat takes a shitload less work than to feed 100 people with rice due to wheat giving far more energy
 (that's said by some to be the reason western europe grew ahead of the rest of the world the past 2000 years or so)
Wolfy Tom says:
 talking city states built on Tepui in rainforest
 agriulture taking place on tepui plateaus so each is isolated but starting the same
David says:
 let me put it differently...
 give me 1 reason they WOULD work out the same
 in the real world at least, even if starting out identically, there would be trillions of factors that could ruin one place but not the other
Wolfy Tom says:
 they are close enough to have a similar climate, economy, environment/biome/ecosystem
 same technology
David says:
 what about leadership?
Wolfy Tom says:
 city-states ar all kinda feudal but not in a backward sense
David says:
 and religion?
 i suppose a feudal systems leave a lot of room for corruption etc
Wolfy Tom says:
 not really sure as far as the city-state inhabitants go - maybe some kind of cargo-cult thing
 religion is hard for me to imagine - i dont know enough about it
David says:
 perhaps their religion forbids them to eat whatever is the most common source of food in the area lol
Wolfy Tom says:
 interesting consept
 c
David says:
 like if cows were the main source of food in india
 that'd be a problem for a lot of people
Wolfy Tom says:
 ifind it hard to concieve of a society allowing a religion to develop which denies the staple and only rliable source of food 
David says:
 lol if anything could do it it's religion
Wolfy Tom says:
 shit
 how the fuck do i go about researching rel gon
 i's knda a big subjct

David says:

Wolfy Tom says:
 what's the engine for?
David says:
 it actually says A State Of Trance 17 times in that post
 and 14 times Armin van buuren
 it's a Hemi V8, normally found in chryslers and dodges etc
 they had a contest called "What Can You Hemi" with the goal to use a HEMI V8 for the weirdest thing
 i bet that's what Top Gear's V8 Food Blender was based on
Wolfy Tom says:

 winamps is playing it!
Wolfy Tom says:
 random?
David says:
 i put on my movie soundtracks playlist
Wolfy Tom says:
 serendipity
David says:
 although your track isn't a soundtrack it fits in perfectly
Wolfy Tom says:
  
David says:
 it was the first track winamps played when i opened the playlist
 wouldn't have been bad in Donnie Darko
Wolfy Tom says:
 i liked that film
David says:
 although not a perfect match with the current soundtrack (certainly not far off though) but it would be a very nice replacement and fit well with the movie if it was all done in your style
Wolfy Tom says:
 just wait for my 420 mix...
David says:
 but the movie it would be perfect for
Wolfy Tom says:
 and the two albums i'm working on
 or do i mean 3?
David says:
 is
 <searching for title lol>
Wolfy Tom says:
 and the book i would like to make progress on
David says:
 28 Days!
 yes!
 that's the movie
Wolfy Tom says:
 you mean 28 days later?
David says:
 hmm maybe
 they both exist
 wait lemme check
 err yes, 28 Days Later
 there's a scene that has a track with very similar music
Wolfy Tom says:
 phew]
David says:
 lol
 perhaps in Sunshine as well
 both of them have music by John Murphy btw
Wolfy Tom says:
 interesting
David says:
 oooh this music is pretty
 John Murphy - Capa's Last Transmission Home
 from Sunshine
Wolfy Tom said (20:29):
 are you reading?
David says:
 yes
 the encyclopaedia about the planets and stuff
Wolfy Tom says:
 glad you reading that frist - you'll see what i'm talking abou in the book itself
David says:
 hehe
 No axial tilt in the plane of the stars results in a very steady climate, seasonless year and exceedingly dry yet cold poles - permafrost and tundra?
 i like the idea of dry poles
 rocky and fucking cold
Wolfy Tom says:
 there could be tundra, reindeer and wfls!
David says:
 but there can be wfls on rocky lands too!
 they could live in caves and stuff
 to sleeps
Wolfy Tom says:
  
David says:
 These unnatural canopy plataus exists because they were engineered in - they wouldn't last evolutionarily but since the tress take ten thousand years to grow to maturity here has been paractically no change from the original bioengineered ones. [still need some sort of excuse for branch/canopy plateaus...]
 engineered hunting grounds?
Wolfy Tom says:
 interesting - that would imply the place would be populated by things to hunt...?
David says:
 exactly
 could be a whole encylopaedia by itself
 but one thing is a little unclear...
 the big trees
 are they on the plateau's or down there in the water?
Wolfy Tom says:
 oh!
 they root in the water but grow so tall they are near plateau level in height
David says:
 can people walk from the plateau to the canopy?
Wolfy Tom says:
 i dont think they are quite that high
 plus the tepui cant be perfectly vertical so i dont think the canopy reaches quite to the cliff side
David says:
 yeah i guess
 so do the people live in the trees or on the land or both?
Wolfy Tom says:
 yes
 both
 alchemist clans live in the heart of the treehouse sort of land
 there are nomadic hunter gatherer tribes in dangerouser parts of cloud forest
 all trees root in shallow saltwater "oceans"
 so probly no people cos no light
 and too much roots and scaryshit
 people on tepui plateaus - city states on rock outcrops, agricutlture on plateau tops
David says:
 cool
Wolfy Tom says:
 MOCEAN DISTRICT JUST PLAYED A JINGL FOR SIRIUS FM!

Wolfy Tom says:
 it is a kilner jar with a special bulb that is sunlight output, but there is photovoltaic cell to recharge a battery
 during day it looks like a jar, and at night theres a warm, soft golden glow
 it's weather proof and runs for ever
David says:
